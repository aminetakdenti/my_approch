# Convolutional Neural Networks for Tabular Data Classification: A Novel Approach

## Abstract

This paper presents a novel approach to tabular data classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We propose a methodology that transforms traditional tabular data into a 2D representation suitable for CNN processing, leveraging the spatial learning capabilities of CNNs for improved classification performance.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional machine learning approaches for tabular data classification often rely on tree-based methods or fully connected neural networks. However, these methods may not capture complex feature interactions effectively. This work explores the application of CNNs, typically used for image processing, to tabular data classification by transforming the data into a spatial representation.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Transformation

The core of our approach lies in the transformation of tabular data into a 2D representation:

1. **Feature Vector to 2D Matrix**:
   - Given n features, we find the smallest square number greater than or equal to n
   - The feature vector is padded to this square dimension
   - The padded vector is reshaped into a square matrix

2. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   For a feature vector X ∈ ℝⁿ, we:
   - Calculate side length: s = ⌈√n⌉
   - Create padded vector: X' ∈ ℝ^(s²)
   - Reshape to matrix: M ∈ ℝ^(s×s)

### 2.2 Network Architecture

Our CNN architecture consists of:

1. **Input Layer**:
   - Single channel (grayscale-like representation)
   - Batch normalization for input stabilization

2. **Convolutional Layers**:
   - First layer: 16 filters (3×3 kernel)
   - Second layer: 32 filters (3×3 kernel)
   - Each followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation

3. **Pooling and Regularization**:
   - Max pooling (2×2)
   - Dropout layers (25% 2D dropout, 50% regular dropout)

4. **Fully Connected Layers**:
   - 64 neurons in hidden layer
   - Output layer with k neurons (k = number of classes)

### 2.3 Training Process

The training process incorporates several best practices:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Standard scaling of features
   - Train-test split (80-20)
   - Batch processing

2. **Optimization**:
   - AdamW optimizer
   - Learning rate scheduling
   - Gradient clipping
   - Early stopping

3. **Regularization**:
   - Batch normalization
   - Dropout
   - Weight decay

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Data Preparation

```python
def prepare_data(csv_path, test_size=0.2, batch_size=32):
    # Load and preprocess data
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)
    X = df.iloc[:, :-1].values
    y = df.iloc[:, -1].values
    
    # Scale features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X = scaler.fit_transform(X)
    
    # Transform to 2D
    side_length = int(np.ceil(np.sqrt(X.shape[1])))
    X_padded = np.pad(X, ((0, 0), (0, side_length**2 - X.shape[1])), 'constant')
    X_reshaped = X_padded.reshape(-1, 1, side_length, side_length)
```

### 3.2 Model Architecture

```python
class CNNModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channels, height, width, output_dim):
        super(CNNModel, self).__init__()
        # Input normalization
        self.input_bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(input_channels)
        
        # Convolutional layers
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(input_channels, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        
        # Pooling and dropout
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.dropout2d = nn.Dropout2d(0.25)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)
```

## 4. Advantages of the Approach

1. **Feature Interaction Learning**:
   - CNNs can learn complex patterns in the spatial arrangement of features
   - Local feature interactions are captured through convolutional operations

2. **Regularization Benefits**:
   - Multiple regularization techniques improve generalization
   - Batch normalization helps with training stability

3. **Flexibility**:
   - Can handle varying numbers of features through padding
   - Adaptable to different classification tasks

## 5. Limitations and Future Work

1. **Current Limitations**:
   - Arbitrary feature ordering in 2D representation
   - Potential information loss in padding
   - Computational overhead of 2D transformation

2. **Future Directions**:
   - Feature importance-based arrangement
   - Dynamic padding strategies
   - Hybrid architectures combining CNN with traditional methods

## 6. Conclusion

This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying CNNs to tabular data classification through a novel data transformation approach. The method shows promise in capturing complex feature interactions while maintaining the benefits of CNN architectures.
